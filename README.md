# Content

This repository contains R training hosted at shiny.vsb.cz created as part of IT4Innovations training program.

These training are created using [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/).

To run them locally it is best to use [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/). The list of necessary packages for the training is always at the beginning of the Rmd file in the setup chunk.
New version of RStudio will show a notification if any of them is missing on the system.
